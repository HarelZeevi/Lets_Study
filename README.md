# Rules:
1. Pull Before Push - It's simple. Don't push or work on a not updated version of the project.
2. Don't Change the configuration.
3. If you have another folder you want to add - contact Harel the manager of the configuration Team. 
4. Remember to pull every few days to stay updated.

# What should I put In each folder?
The answer is very simple:

# /doc 
Here you put your documentation files.
For each folder with code (under /script) will be documaentation files.
In the file (which is going to be an .md file) you'll do the following:
give a short describe of the code files in it which includes it's purpose (2 - 3 sentences)
and The languages that have been used in it.  

# /res
Here you need to put all the resources you are using. 
Currently there are only images. If you need to add an audio file or
another file that is not an image - contact Harel Zeevi from the configuration team
And He'll take care of it ;)

# /test
This directory will be mostly used by the testing team. 
Here you'll put all the tests you have written.

# /src
This one is simple.
If you use someone's code that have already been written just add it here.
That way everyone will be able to run the code's you have writen without having any issues.
