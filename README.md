# Rules:
1. Pull Before Push - It's simple. Don't push or work on an outdated version of the project.
2. Don't Change the configuration.
4. <h1>Remember to pull every few days to stay updated.</h1>

# What should I put In each folder?
The answer is very simple:

# /script
 This directory is the scripts of all the project
 ðŸ¢ƒ
 ## Contains:
 <h3> Back-End </h3>
 for server & database files.
 <h3> Front-End</h3>
 for react & js files.

# /res
Here you need to put all the resources you are using. 
Currently there are only images.

# /test
This directory will be mostly used to test scripts, jsons or any files.
